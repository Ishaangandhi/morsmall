#+TITLE: Morsmall -- A concise AST for POSIX shell
#+STARTUP: indent inlineimages

This library is a small wrapper around [[https://gitlab.inria.fr/regisgia/morbig/][morbig]].  Morbig provides a
parser and a CST representation of POSIX shell scripts which may
contain too much information for certain uses.

Morsmall provides a converter from Morbig's CST to an AST that aims to
be easely understandable and manipulable.  It also provides a printer
from that AST to Shell.
